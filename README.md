# NoteAPP_FullStack
This is my first personal project, in which I continued my learning and practice with Java SpringBoot, Javascript ReactJS, as well as in writing quality code. In this project, I learned about crud concepts and Fetch for consuming data from my backend.

The project consists of a task annotator, which allows you to create, edit, delete, archive, and unarchive tasks. It contains two sections, one for archived notes and another for unarchived notes.

Tech stack:
✔️ Java
✔️ Maven
✔️ Spring Boot
✔️ Javascript
✔️ Html
✔️ Css
✔️ ReactJS
✔️ MySQL
✔️ Postman
